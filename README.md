# SURS_EconomicIndicatorFromOJA
An example of usage of OJA to forecast an economic indicator used in Slovenia as a component for the calculation of the GDP.

This example is presented in Jupyter Notebook using R 3.6.3. It's important to not use R 4.X for this example due to the use of some dropped packages.

Includes the following R libraries:
 * dplyr
 * data.table
 * lubridate
 * TSA
 * forecast
 * IRdisplay (used in the Notebook for LaTEX integration)
